  different teams and clubs i've played many sports and traviled to someplace and
  experinced different cultures and traditions.Ever since I was a child I have
  always liked tech my mother has always exposed me to tech as child and have
  always had great friends whom incourage me to follow my dreams and do what I
  love, which makes me who I am today. In school I was in the part in the debate
   team and now I am the President of the chess club In the summer of 2017 I took and amazing
  choice to be a part of girls who code which has opened me up to many different
  fields of tech and I have done many activities in girls who code.
